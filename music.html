    <h1>Shubh Varshney's Favorite Music</h1>
    <p>Who doesn't love music! When I'm doing something and if it seems really quiet or boring, I go to music! However, I often do not pay attention to who I am listening to or what I am listening to. But I do remember some singers and songs that really stood out to me!</p>

    <h2>Song 1: <span class="songName">Evidemment</span> by La Zarra</h2>
    <p>I really love this song. I know a bit of French, so this song sounds really beautiful and fulfilling.</p>

    <h2>Song 2: <span class="songName">Tu Maan Meri Jaan</span> by Nick Jonas and King</h2>
    <p>This song is a really good mash up between two languages. I know both Hindi and English, and I love how both the singers bring the song together!</p>

    <h2>Song 3: <span class="songName">Never Gonna Give You Up</span> by Rick Astley</h2>
    <p>This song is pretty infamous, but I think I've heard it so much it's pretty good. However, it's funny when someone "rickrolls" someone with a song such as this one.</p>

    <h2>Other songs I like.</h2>
    <ul id="musicUL">
      <li><span class="songName">Uptown Funk</span> by Bruno Mars</li>
      <li><span class="songName">Smells Like Teen Spirit</span> by Nirvana</li>
      <li><span class="songName">Stayin' Alive</span> by Bee Gees</li>
    </ul>
    <p>I <strong>LOVE</strong> playing these songs as well. I'm not so good at it, but I try to learn some of these songs on the piano.</p>
